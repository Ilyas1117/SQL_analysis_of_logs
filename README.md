This project focuses on analyzing user activity on the SDU University portal using SQL queries. 
The goal was to explore patterns in portal usage, identify trends, and generate meaningful insights 
from the logs data. The dataset includes user actions, timestamps, and other relevant information 
collected over time.

Using SQL, I performed various analyses such as:

Counting user logins and actions
The device count of each user
Detecting potential anomalies or unusual behavior

This project demonstrates my ability to work with real-world datasets, write complex SQL queries, 
aggregate and filter data effectively, and interpret results to support data-driven decisions. It
showcases foundational data engineering and analytical skills applicable in professional 
environments.
